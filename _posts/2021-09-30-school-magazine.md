## Prelude

So when I was in my $9^{th}$ grade I had joined the debate club in the middle of the school year (*as far as I remember, yes I'm a bit forgetful*). About the end of the year one of the clubs teacher, Amrita (Chatterjee) Ma'am asked me and a few people if we'd like to emcee on the first day of the new school year. We auditioned and I got the part. Now the first day of the new school year happened with me completing my part. So the story's over.

Well that isn't helpful at all in explaining the title now, is it? So lets continue.

So in this new year, I was in class $10^{th}$ now, the debate club resumed (*which I truly wasn't very good at, maybe because I can't really take an extreme of a viewpoint*). Well one fine day, at the end of the debating session Amrita Ma'am suddenly asked few people if they want to be the editor of the school magazine. Well one of those people was me! I couldn't really believe it! I mean I didn't (and still don't) have the best of writing skills- I can't really use complex phrases/words, don't really write that elegantly and my style of writing is really wierd I think.
Well for whatever reason (I'll come to it later) I was in the editorial team of the school magazine. At this point of time I hadn't really done much of *actual writing* beside the occasional story or article in an english test. Frankly even now after about 5 years, I haven't written much, mainly because I'm lazy and just like to keep the words in my head.
The reason I was infact selected by a teacher, whom i didn't actually know of much at that time, was basically due to the fact that apparently teachers like to talk in staffrooms like the humans they are! Ha! Who would have imagined teachers as humans! At that point of time they were basically another breed of creatures to us students.
So teachers talk and I'll thank my english ma'am from class 9 through 10, Sumita Ma'am for recommending me for the magazine editor thing. It was a really fun experience rejecting and accepting writeups from students. Though typing them and editing them was not so fun, it was offset by the fact that we got to sit in the Air Conditioned Room with computers( called Teacher's Resource Lab ).
I guess that concludes the story, rather abruptly I'd say , now that read through it again. But let the keystrokes of a purely human rant not be sullied by the quest for perfection and let it be.

### The Magazine Cover

So we had a lot of couplets (*dohas*) in our 10th grade. Inspired by them I set on a quest to write my own which would hopefully be read, deciphered and debated upon by the future generations in the eons to come.
Basically it's not that tough (atleast I didn't feel so). It's like encryption- you've got to encode a message in a cryptic language. So i just wrote up *a couple of couplets* (haha! see what i did here?) and then being the generous and resourceful editor I was approved them for the magzine.
Secretly, well not so secret anymore, I believe the more famous you are the better meaning and depth your works seem to have along with a better reach ofcourse.
