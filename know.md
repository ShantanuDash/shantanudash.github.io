**The phrase X appeared in print in its modern meaning in 1770 when, at the death of George Whitefield, John Wesley wrote a memorial sermon which acknowledged but downplayed the two men's doctrinal differences:**

**Despite his inestimable contributions to the field of Mathematics, astronomy and
engineering, he is more associated with an anecdote and his subsequent
discovery of a method for determining volume.**

**His dedication to mathematics was so much that even when he was about to be
killed he supposedly uttered “Do not disturb my circles", a reference to the circles
in the mathematical drawing that he was studying.**

**Habitually single, Locusts can sometimes explode in population and transform into a swarm of disaster changing from dull green to striking yellow and black. Eating up large areas of standing crop fields. Eventually with a supply-demand disequilibrium, they could turn cannibalistic feeding on each other.**

**Probably insects have a liking for grids with appendages, In the 1940's ENIAC built for the US Army had warm and bright vacuum tubes that were peppered by moths in large numbers and disrupted the relays thus impelling the Engineers to maintain an 'Error log'? 
What do we do then? Just Hit it! And most of us call it???**

> The terms "bug" and "debugging" are popularly attributed to Admiral Grace Hopper in the 1940s. While she was working on a Mark II computer at Harvard University, her associates discovered a moth stuck in a relay and thereby impeding operation, whereupon she remarked that they were "debugging" the system.

**On June 6, 1822, Canadian Alexis St. Martin was accidentally shot in the stomach with a musket. This left a hole through his side permanently, with a fistula aperture directly into the stomach. U.S. Army surgeon William Beaumont used this unique opportunity to study a poorly understood process. He would tie a food item to a string, lower it into the hole and take it out at timed intervals to study it. What process do we know better thanks to this freak accident?**

### Q16
**In 1882, a boy named Charles was born in Lugo, Italy.His family was not wealthy and was going through a rough phase.But little Charles always liked money.At that time, Italians were migrating to the USA in search of economic opportunities and Charles jumped on a ship too. On reaching the US, he looked for odd jobs in the city of Boston.
After repeatedly doing many jobs and failing in them and also going to prison for some he started a new business.**

**He promised clients a 50% profit within 45 days or 100% profit within 90 days, by buying discounted postal reply coupons in other countries and redeeming them at face value in the U.S. as a form of arbitrage.In reality, he was paying earlier investors using the investments of later investors. While this type of fraudulent investment scheme was not originally invented by him, it became so identified with him that it now is referred to as a "X scheme." His scheme ran for over a year before it collapsed, costing his "investors" $20 million (inflation adjusted to $250 million as of 2020).**

Gimme X.

### Q19
- This now very famous greeting/gesture first appeared in the season 2 episode
opener “Amok Time” of X show, the initial idea was the character kneeling
before a matriarch , who places her hands on his shoulders, like royalty dubbing a
knight, but the actor felt this would be an invasion of privacy as the race he plays
on the show are touch telepaths.


- Hence the actor drew from his Jewish heritage and based the greeting on the
blessing gesture used by the kohanim koe hah NEEM ) during the worship
service. The kohanim are the genealogical descendants of the Jewish priests who
served in the Jerusalem Temple


- The blessing depicts the Hebrew letter “shin” shin”(SH), which in this case stands for
the word Shaddai, meaning “Almighty (God)".

### It is now widely recognized more for the show than for its Jewish Origin . What is this greeting? Give X

### Q22
**In 1961, Lorenz was using a simple digital computer, a Royal McBee LGP-30, to simulate weather patterns by modeling 12 variables, representing things like temperature and wind speed. He wanted to see a sequence of data again, and to save time he started the simulation in the middle of its course. He did this by entering a printout of the data that corresponded to conditions in the middle of the original simulation. To his surprise, the weather that the machine began to predict was completely different from the previous calculation. The culprit: a rounded decimal number on the computer printout. The computer worked with 6-digit precision, but the printout rounded variables off to a 3-digit number, so a value like 0.506127 printed as 0.506. This difference is tiny, and the consensus at the time would have been that it should have no practical effect. However, Lorenz discovered  ` _that small changes in initial conditions produced large changes in long-term outcome._ `**

**Dr. May studied physics and mathematics at Imperial College London, graduating with a BSc (Hons) degree and ARCS in physics with Upper Second-Class Honours. From 1970 to 1974, he studied for a PhD degree at Imperial College, studying reflected light from interplanetary dust and the velocity of dust in the plane of the Solar System.
